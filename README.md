# webDev101
a repo to keep track of stuff I learn on "The Odin Project" - Web Dev 101 course

I pretend to track my progression here, for that effect, I made a small custom-web page, which will have all the exercices and stuff I do, as I cross 'em.

# Feel free to customize and use this for your own learning as well, fork it and hack it!
